GConf Cleaner
===============
GConf Cleaner is a tool to clean your GConf database up that
is possibly ate away with the unnecessary keys anymore or
the invalid keys.  You may want to keep a clean your GConf
database. this tool might help you in this case.

IMPORTANT: READ THIS BEFORE DOING
===================================
On some applications, they put the GConf keys without
schemas. in such case, your applications might be damaged
after cleaning up. I'd recommend to save an registry in
GConf from GConf Cleaner before actually cleaning up and if
you see any weird behavior in your applications, restore
your lost keys with gconftool --load <saved filename>.
